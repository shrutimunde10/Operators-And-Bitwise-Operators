# Operators-And-Bitwise-Operators
Theory:
Bitwise operators in C++ carry out operations on integer data at the bit-level. Testing, setting, or shifting the actual bits is one of these processes.

Operator	Description
&	Bitwise AND Operator
or	Bitwise OR Operator
^	Bitwise XOR Operator
~	Bitwise Complement Operator
<<	Bitwise Shift Left Operator
>>	Bitwise Shift Right Operator
The right shift operator shifts all bits towards the right by a certain number of specified bits. The left shift operator shifts all bits towards the left by a certain number of specified bits.
